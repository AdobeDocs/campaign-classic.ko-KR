# 프로필 시작하기{#about-profiles}



프로필은 Adobe Campaign 데이터베이스에 중앙 집중화됩니다. 프로필을 가져오고 이 데이터베이스를 빌드하는 데 사용할 수 있는 메커니즘은 웹 양식을 통한 온라인 수집, 텍스트 파일 수동 또는 자동 가져오기, 회사 데이터베이스 또는 기타 정보 시스템을 사용한 복제와 같이 다양합니다. Adobe Campaign을 사용하면 마케팅 기록, 구매 정보, 환경 설정, CRM 데이터 및 관련 PI 데이터를 통합 보기에 통합하여 분석하고 조치를 취할 수 있습니다.

&quot;**프로필**&quot;은(는) 최종 고객, 잠재 고객 또는 잠재 고객을 나타내는 정보 기록(예: 쿠키 ID, 고객 ID, 모바일 식별자 또는 특정 채널과 관련된 기타 정보가 포함된 외부 테이블 또는 nmsRecipient 테이블의 레코드)을 의미합니다.

Adobe Campaign에서 수신자는 게재(전자 메일, SMS 등)를 보낼 타겟팅된 기본 프로필입니다. 데이터베이스에 저장된 수신자 데이터를 사용하면 지정된 게재를 받을 대상을 필터링하고 게재 콘텐츠에 개인화 데이터를 추가할 수 있습니다. 데이터베이스에 다른 유형의 프로필이 있습니다. 다양한 용도로 디자인되어 있습니다. 예를 들어 최종 대상으로 전송되기 전에 시드 프로필을 테스트하여 게재를 테스트합니다.

## Profile types {#profile-types}

Adobe Campaign lets you manage profiles throughout their entire lifecycle: creation, import, targeting, action tracking, updates, etc.

Each profile matches a database entry. They contain all the information required for targeting, qualifying and tracking individuals.

Profiles can be identified based on storage space. This means that a profile can match: a recipient, a visitor, an operator, a subscriber, a prospect, etc.

## Recipient profiles {#recipient-profiles}

Delivery recipients are stored in the database as profiles containing the information linked to them: last name, first name, address, subscriptions, deliveries, etc. When you create campaigns, you can define the target of the deliveries to a selection of the profiles in the base according to simple or advanced criteria.

You can also create campaigns aimed at recipients whose profiles are stored not in the database, but in files. These are known as "external" deliveries. For more information about this type of delivery, refer to [this page](../../delivery/using/steps-defining-the-target-population.md#selecting-external-recipients).

The main methods for creating recipient profiles are as follows:

* direct input in the graphical interface screens,
* importing recipient lists,
* on-line collection via web forms.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To find out how files and web forms are imported, refer to [Generic imports and exports](../../platform/using/get-started-data-import-export.md).

## Profiles and targets {#profiles-and-targets}

The **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets]** link lets you display recipients stored in Adobe Campaign database. You can create new recipient, edit an existing recipient and access its profile. For more on this, refer to [this page](../../platform/using/editing-a-profile.md).

![](assets/d_ncs_user_interface_target_link.png)

It also gives you access to:

* lists - [Learn more](../../platform/using/creating-and-managing-lists.md)
* subscription services - [Learn more](../../delivery/using/managing-subscriptions.md)
* web applications - [Learn more](../../web/using/about-web-applications.md)
* imports and exports (jobs) - [Learn more](../../platform/using/about-generic-imports-exports.md)
* targeting workflows - [Learn more](../../workflow/using/building-a-workflow.md#implementation-steps-)

The recipients page lets you perform frequent operations on profiles: edits, updates, adds, deletions, sorts.

For more advanced profile manipulations, you need to edit the Adobe Campaign tree. To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Explorer]** link on the Adobe Campaign home page.

By default, recipients are stored in the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and Targets > Recipients]** node of the tree. You can create recipients from this view, as well as:

* sort and filter the profiles of the database - [Learn more](../../platform/using/filtering-options.md)
* move, copy or delete profiles from the database - [Learn more](../../platform/using/managing-profiles.md),
* update profiles - [Learn more](../../platform/using/updating-data.md)
* export recipients - [Learn more](../../platform/using/exporting-and-importing-profiles.md)
* create recipient groups - [Learn more](../../platform/using/creating-and-managing-lists.md)

To access advanced functionalities and configurations, you need to click the **[!UICONTROL Explorer]** icon. 

![](assets/d_ncs_user_interface01.png)

The general layout of the Adobe Campaign explorer is presented in [this page](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-explorer.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also display an advanced view of this list from the Adobe Campaign tree by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Profiles and targets > Recipients]** link. The list display can be configured to suit your needs. You can add or delete columns, define column order, sort data, etc. List display configuration is described in [this page](../../platform/using/adobe-campaign-ui-lists.md).  
>
>You can also define recipient views. For further information about this functionality, refer to [this section](../../platform/using/access-management-folders.md).

## Active profiles {#active-profiles}

An active profile is a profile that customer has attempted to communicate with during the past 12 months via any channel.

According to your contract, each of your Campaign instances is provisioned with a specific amount of active profiles that are counted for billing purposes. Please refer to your latest contract for reference on number of purchased active profiles. Learn more in [Adobe Campaign product description](https://helpx.adobe.com/kr/legal/product-descriptions/adobe-campaign-managed-cloud-services.html){target="_blank"}.

You can monitor the number of active profiles on your instance directly from Campaign Control Panel. For more on this, refer to the [Control Panel documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/control-panel/using/performance-monitoring/active-profiles-monitoring.html?lang=ko){target="_blank"}.

The following guardrails and limitations apply:

* A profile that has been targeted by several deliveries is counted only once. 
* Profiles targeted in the context of Social marketing on X (Twitter) or Facebook are not taken into account as active profiles.
* The count of active profiles is available for **Marketing instances** only. It is not available for Execution instances, meaning MID (mid sourcing) and RT (Message Center / Real-time messaging) instances.
* The count is based on the recipient primary key. As a consequence, if a profile is present in two different recipient tables, it can be counted twice as an active profile.
