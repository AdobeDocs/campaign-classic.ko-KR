# 마케팅 캠페인 기본 정보{#designing-marketing-campaigns}

Adobe Campaign은 온라인과 오프라인의 모든 채널에서 캠페인을 개인화하고 게재할 수 있는 다양한 솔루션을 제공합니다. 마케팅 캠페인을 생성, 구성, 실행 및 분석할 수 있습니다. 모든 마케팅 캠페인은 통합 제어 센터에서 관리할 수 있습니다.

캠페인에는 작업(게재) 및 프로세스(파일 가져오기 또는 추출)와 리소스(마케팅 문서, 게재 아웃라인)가 포함됩니다. 마케팅 캠페인에서 사용됩니다. 캠페인은 프로그램의 일부이며 프로그램은 캠페인 플랜에 포함됩니다.

Adobe Campaign lets you define, optimize, execute and analyze communications and marketing campaigns. Adobe Campaign acts like a unified order and execution center for marketing strategies. For more on this, refer to [Access campaigns](../../distributed/using/accessing-campaigns.md) and [Create marketing campaigns](../../campaign/using/setting-up-marketing-campaigns.md).

In addition, the **Marketing Resource Management (MRM)** module lets you control marketing actions in a collaborative mode by providing complete management and real-time tracking of the tasks, budgets and marketing resources involved. The Marketing Resource Management lets you optimize and regulate the management of internal and external processes, resources and marketing campaigns, as well as third party relations (agencies, printers, etc.). For more on this, refer to [this section](../../mrm/using/about-marketing-resource-management.md).

## Core concepts {#core-concepts}

The following concepts need to be known in the context of Campaign:

* **Campaign**

  A campaign centralizes all the elements related to a marketing campaign: deliveries, targeting rules, costs, export files, related documents, etc. Each campaign is attached to a program.

  For more on this, refer to [Adding a campaign](../../campaign/using/setting-up-marketing-campaigns.md#adding-a-campaign).

* **Program**

  A program lets you define marketing actions for a calendar period: launch, canvassing, loyalty, etc. Each program contains campaigns linked to a calendar, which provides an overall view.

* **Plan**

  The marketing plan can contain multiple programs. It is linked to a calendar period, has an allocated budget and can also be linked up to documents and objectives.

  For more on this, refer to [Campaign calendar](../../campaign/using/accessing-marketing-campaigns.md#campaign-calendar).

* **Workflow**

  A campaign workflow contains the same activities as for all workflows but is specific to the campaign. It enables you to create and configure deliveries for all available channels.

  For more on this, refer to [this section](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#building-the-main-target-in-a-workflow).

* **Objectives**

  Within the campaign, program or plan, you can state a list of objectives. These are quantified values to be reached. At the end of the campaign, program or plan, the MRM module lets you compare the objectives and results in dedicated reports.

* **Delivery outline**

  A delivery outline is a structured description of a delivery. Every delivery can refer to a delivery outline which contains, for example, the related offers, documents to be attached, or a link to stores. An offer can be referenced in the delivery according to the delivery outline selected.

  For more on this, refer to [this section](../../campaign/using/marketing-campaign-deliveries.md#associating-and-structuring-resources-linked-via-a-delivery-outline).
